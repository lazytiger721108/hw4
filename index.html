            <p>
                We worked in a group to design an interactive interface for an emerging start-up.
                For the start-up that we chose,
                <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/wolfia" target="_blank">Wolfia</a>,
                it was founded by Fabien
                Devos and Naren Manoharan in 2022. The problem they were trying to solve was
                getting feedback to mobile app developers more efficiently and effectively through
                a shared link. Their model included feedback from Product Managers, Designers, and
                other Developers.
            </p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="block1" id="Research" style="margin:50px 40px 40px 40px;position: relative;padding: 30px;">
        <h1 class="caption">Problem & Research</h1>
        <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
            <p>We decided the best way to achieve the goal of getting feedback
                through a shared link was through a web app with multiple “sides”.
            </p>
            <p>
                -On the “Developer” side, developers would be able to upload their mobile
                apps and generate a link to send to various users for testing and feedback.
                They could also access a Feedback studio to ask for specific feedback and
                also see the feedback they have been given.
            </p>
            <p>
                -On the “Reviewer” side, users would be able to use a variety of tools
                (code and non-code) to leave feedback on the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                We generated ideas for our design by creating quick sketches exploring
                various possibilities for the website's interfaces. We focused on the
                pages enabling users to upload an app, view feedback on their app, and
                leave feedback on apps created by others.

        <h3>Hi-Fi Prototyping</h3>
        <p style="color: #fff;font-size: 20px;font-weight: normal;">
            In order to make our design closer to a real finished product, we designed hi-fi prototypes
            with Figma based on lo-fi sketches. In this process, as UI/UX designers, we mainly focus on
            the following 3 angles: interaction, navigation and hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #fff;font-size: 20px;font-weight: normal;">
            (1) Interaction: To increase interaction, we incorporate lots of icons
            (that were both learnable and actionable) into our feedback studio. Additionally,
            based on Jacob Nielsen’s Rule of Thumb, we focused on three things to maximize
            interaction: consistency and standards, match between system and real world
            (or user’s mental models), and user control and freedom. Consistency and
            standards led us to minimize the colors we were using and also make sure that
            we included similar language, formatting, and features on various pages. For
            the match between system and real world, we tried to incorporate aspects of
            common applications (eg. drag and drop to upload), and think about what
            information a new user might need. Lastly, for user control and freedom,
            we wanted to make both the Reviewer Feedback and Developer Feedback as
            customizable and flexible as possible.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #fff;font-size: 20px;font-weight: normal;">
            (2) Navigation: We decided to use a side navigation bar. We also tried to group
            by topic (Project vs. Feedback on the sidebar) so that developers could easily find
            what they were looking for. We tried to test to make sure that users knew where they
            were and could hopefully figure out where they might want to go next.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #fff;font-size: 20px;font-weight: normal;">
            (3) Hierarchy: Used headings, different font weights, and indentation to show the
            hierarchy of different pages.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;">
            <div style="border: 10px solid #fff;width: 20%;box-sizing: border-box;">
                <img src="images/img13.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
            </div>
            <div style="border: 10px solid #fff;width: 20%;box-sizing: border-box;">
                <img src="images/img14.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
            </div>
            <div style="border: 10px solid #fff;width: 20%;box-sizing: border-box;">
                <img src="images/img15.png" style="width: 100%;"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="Testing" style="margin-top: 50px;padding: 20px;font-weight: bold;">
        <h1 class="caption">User Testing</h1>
    </div>

    <div style="font-size: 20px;background-color:#fff;margin-top: 50px;padding: 20px;">
        <h4>Peer Critique</h4>
        <p>
            We had a mockup critique and we were able to receive feedback
            from our peers. During a critique session, our peers pointed out
            some places, such as the hierarchy of the navigation bar and the
            consistency of buttons, where we could improve hierarchy and accessibility
            for users and developers alike. Our group refined our hi-fi prototypes
            with the following feedback.
        </p>

                background, and light icons with white space.

            -<b>User 1:</b> “The left-hand menu could be clearer. I was able to find things
            using the general layout of the design (which helps a user find their way). The
            interface is designed well enough for the average person to figure out, but it
            took me a while.” <br>
            -<b>User 2:</b> Did not leave additional feedback. <br>
            -<b>User 3:</b> “I think [the interface] is laid out very well. Even though
            there is not a lot of color in the site, I still like it. It was still very easy
            [to navigate] on the left hand side. I like the layout and it just helped things
            flow well.” User 3: “It might be nice that once you have edited, something pops
            up like ‘changes saved’ so that you are assured that it does go through, no
            glitches, and it reads what you did... Because sometimes technology happens.
            That might be nice to have there”

    <div style="margin-top: 50px;padding: 20px;font-weight: bold;">

        <div>
            <p>
                For the first task, finding feedback for App 1, two of the users found the task
                to be straightforward and very easy, while the third user struggled to navigate
                the site after getting caught on the “Reviewer” side of the interface as opposed
                to the “Developer” side. For the second and third tasks, all three of the users
                found the tasks to be straightforward and were able to complete them in a timely
                manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on user feedback, we would incorporate more action validation into the
                interface to keep users informed – this aligns with the interaction principle of
                visibility of system status. For example, we could incorporate pop-up windows,
                informative messages, or progress bars to show the user if their desired action
                has been completed. Additionally, we would increase the separation between the
                Reviewer and Developer sides of our prototype and the site itself by having the
                user link pop up in a new browser window. This would address the interaction
                principle of error prevention. We could also potentially add more color to the
                website to increase visual interest.

                I am very proud to design an enterprise-level interactive interface for a good start-up.
                Thanks a lot to all of my teammates for believing and supporting me throughout the whole
                process.

                Moreover, I also learned the importance of user testing. User testing is a core
                component of the UX design process, because only through effective testing can
                eliminate unforeseen problems and potential design mistakes in the design phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, it's a fascinating design, and if I have time, I think I'll try to actually
                implement our design.
