                        We worked in a group to design an interactive interface for an emerging start-up.

                        Devos and Naren Manoharan in 2022. The problem they were trying to solve was
                        getting feedback to mobile app developers more efficiently and effectively through
                        a shared link. Their model included feedback from Product Managers, Designers, and
                        other Developers.

                                <p>We decided the best way to achieve the goal of getting feedback
                                    through a shared link was through a web app with multiple “sides”.

                                    -On the “Developer” side, developers would be able to upload their mobile
                                    apps and generate a link to send to various users for testing and feedback.
                                    They could also access a Feedback studio to ask for specific feedback and
                                    also see the feedback they have been given.
                                </p>

                                    -On the “Reviewer” side, users would be able to use a variety of tools
                                    (code and non-code) to leave feedback on the app.

                                    We generated ideas for our design by creating quick sketches exploring
                                    various possibilities for the website's interfaces. We focused on the
                                    pages enabling users to upload an app, view feedback on their app, and
                                    leave feedback on apps created by others.

                        <p class="text-white slide-txt">
                            In order to make our design closer to a real finished product, we designed hi-fi prototypes
                            with Figma based on lo-fi sketches. In this process, as UI/UX designers, we mainly focus on
                            the following 3 angles: interaction, navigation and hierarchy.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="text-white slide-txt">
                            <li>
                                (1) Interaction: To increase interaction, we incorporate lots of icons
                                (that were both learnable and actionable) into our feedback studio. Additionally,
                                based on Jacob Nielsen’s Rule of Thumb, we focused on three things to maximize
                                interaction: consistency and standards, match between system and real world
                                (or user’s mental models), and user control and freedom. Consistency and
                                standards led us to minimize the colors we were using and also make sure that
                                we included similar language, formatting, and features on various pages. For
                                the match between system and real world, we tried to incorporate aspects of
                                common applications (eg. drag and drop to upload), and think about what
                                information a new user might need. Lastly, for user control and freedom,
                                we wanted to make both the Reviewer Feedback and Developer Feedback as
                                customizable and flexible as possible.

                                (2) Navigation: We decided to use a side navigation bar. We also tried to group
                                by topic (Project vs. Feedback on the sidebar) so that developers could easily find
                                what they were looking for. We tried to test to make sure that users knew where they
                                were and could hopefully figure out where they might want to go next.

                                hierarchy of different pages.

                                <p>We had a mockup critique and we were able to receive feedback
                                    from our peers. During a critique session, our peers pointed out
                                    some places, such as the hierarchy of the navigation bar and the
                                    consistency of buttons, where we could improve hierarchy and accessibility
                                    for users and developers alike. Our group refined our hi-fi prototypes
                                    with the following feedback.</p>

                                        For the first task, finding feedback for App 1, two of the users found the task
                                        to be straightforward and very easy, while the third user struggled to navigate
                                        the site after getting caught on the “Reviewer” side of the interface as opposed
                                        to the “Developer” side. For the second and third tasks, all three of the users
                                        found the tasks to be straightforward and were able to complete them in a timely

                                        Based on user feedback, we would incorporate more action validation into the
                                        interface to keep users informed – this aligns with the interaction principle of
                                        visibility of system status. For example, we could incorporate pop-up windows,
                                        informative messages, or progress bars to show the user if their desired action
                                        has been completed. Additionally, we would increase the separation between the
                                        Reviewer and Developer sides of our prototype and the site itself by having the
                                        user link pop up in a new browser window. This would address the interaction
                                        principle of error prevention. We could also potentially add more color to the
                                        website to increase visual interest.

                                I am very proud to design an enterprise-level interactive interface for a good start-up.
                                Thanks a lot to all of my teammates for believing and supporting me throughout the whole
                                process.

                                Moreover, I also learned the importance of user testing. User testing is a core
                                component of the UX design process, because only through effective testing can
                                eliminate unforeseen problems and potential design mistakes in the design phase.
                            </p>

                                Overall, it's a fascinating design, and if I have time, I think I'll try to actually
                                implement our design.
