        <div class="illustrationInfoBox" id="12">
            <div class="textItemsAbout">
                <p>For our start-up, we chose <a href="https://www.wolfia.com/">Wolfia</a> from the Y-Combinator
                    accelerator.
                    It was founded by Fabien Devos and Naren Manoharan in 2022.
                    The problem they were trying to solve was getting feedback to mobile app developers more
                    efficiently and effectively through a shared link.
                    Their model included feedback from Product Managers, Designers, and other Developers. </p>
                <p>We decided the best way to achieve the goal of getting feedback through a
                    shared link was through a web app with multiple “sides”. On the “Developer”
                    side, developers would be able to upload their mobile apps and generate a link
                    to send to various users for testing and feedback. They could also access a
                    Feedback studio to ask for specific feedback and also see the feedback they
                    have been given. On the “Reviewer” side, users would be able to
                    use a variety of tools (code and non-code) to leave feedback on the app. </p>
                <p>We generated ideas for our design by creating quick sketches exploring various
                    possibilities for the website's interfaces. We focused on the pages enabling users to upload an app,
                    view feedback on their app, and leave feedback on apps created by others.</p>

                <div class="titleFeature">In order to turn our sketches into wireframes, we focused on the
                    principles of interaction: interaction, navigation, and hierarchy:
                </div>
                <p>Interaction: To increase interaction, we incorporate lots of icons (that
                    were both learnable and actionable) into our feedback studio. Additionally,
                    based on Jacob Nielsen’s Rule of Thumb, we focused on three things to maximize
                    interaction: consistency and standards, match between system and real world
                    (or user’s mental models), and user control and freedom. Consistency and
                    standards led us to minimize the colors we were using and also make sure t
                    hat we included similar language, formatting, and features on various pages.
                    For the match between system and real world, we tried to incorporate aspects
                    of common applications (eg. drag and drop to upload), and think about what
                    information a new user might need. Lastly, for user control and freedom, we wanted
                    to make both the Reviewer
                    Feedback and Developer Feedback as customizable and flexible as possible. </p>
                <p>Navigation: We decided to use a side navigation bar. We also tried to
                    group by topic (Project vs. Feedback on the sidebar) so that developers
                    could easily find what they were looking for. We tried to test to
                    make sure that users knew where they were and
                    could hopefully figure out where they might want to go next. </p>
                <p>Hierarchy: Used headings, different font weights, and
                    indentation to show the hierarchy of different pages. </p>

                <p>User 1: “The left-hand menu could be clearer. I was able to find things using the general
                    layout of the design (which helps a user find their way).
                    The interface is designed well enough for the average person to figure out, but it took me
                    a while.” </p>
                <p>User 2: Did not leave additional feedback.</p>
                <p>User 3: “I think [the interface] is laid out very well.
                    Even though there is not a lot of color in the site, I still like it. It was still very easy
                    [to navigate] on the left hand side.
                    I like the layout and it just helped things flow well.”</p>
                <p>User 3: “It might be nice that once you have edited, something pops up like
                    ‘changes saved’ so that you are assured that it does go through, no glitches,
                    and it read what you did...

                <div class="modelingImageTitle">Analysis of User Testing</div>
                <p>For the first task, finding feedback for App 1, two of the users
                    found the task to be straightforward and very easy, while the third user
                    struggled to navigate the site after getting caught on the “Reviewer” side
                    of the interface as opposed to the “Developer” side. For the second and third
                    tasks, all three of the users found the tasks to be
                    straightforward and were able to complete them in a timely manner. </p>

                <p>Based on user feedback, we would incorporate more action
                    validation into the interface to keep users informed – this aligns
                    with the interaction principle of visibility of system status. For
                    example, we could incorporate pop-up windows, informative messages, or
                    progress bars to show the user if their desired action has been completed.
                    Additionally, we would increase the separation between the Reviewer
                    and Developer sides of our prototype and the site itself by
                    having the user link pop up in a new browser window. This would
                    address the interaction principle of error prevention. We could also potentially
                    add more color to the website to increase visual interest. </p>

                <p>Persona and storyboarding, two effective tools for a designer, not only enable me to better
                    understand how groups of users interact with a product, but also further my understanding of a
                    product.</p>
                <p>During this assignment, I learned a lot of lessons. First of all, I should clearly state my
                    observation, which is different from interviews. Second, the storyboard is built based on the
                    persona, so the storyboard must fit the persona exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    According to the feedback from reviewers, most of them think that our design is visually appealing
                    and shows details about user feedback and how we addressed changes. But for our "minimalist style",
                    some reviewers think that the interface is a bit monotone, which may be hard to identify key
                    graphics and make the learning process harder for the admins. Also some reviewers are still confused
                    about some of the function/button names.
                </p>
                <p>If I have time, I will refactor my persona and storyboard to make my storyboard more suitable for my
                    persona. Moreover, I will have more interview questions, such as users' views on a certain
                    component, etc., so as to understand the user experience more comprehensively.</p>
